	GStreamer is an open-source multimedia framework that allows you to build and manipulate multimedia pipelines for various tasks, including video playback, audio processing, and streaming.

- It is widely used in the Linux and open-source software ecosystems but can also be used on other platforms, including Windows and mac OS.

- **GStreamer Concepts**:
    - **Elements**: GStreamer pipelines are constructed by connecting various elements, which represent different components of a multimedia pipeline. Elements can be sources (e.g., files, cameras), filters (e.g., video/audio codecs, converters), and sinks (e.g., displays, files, network destinations).
        
    - **Pipelines**: A pipeline is a sequence of connected elements that define the flow of multimedia data. Elements are connected in a linear fashion, and data flows from source elements, through filter elements, and ultimately to sink elements.
        
    - **Bins**: Bins are containers for elements, allowing you to group elements together. This can be useful for organising complex pipelines.

GStreamer has official bindings for languages like C, C++, Python, and more.
